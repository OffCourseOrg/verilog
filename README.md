## Evaluation Toolchain

[yoSYS SBY Reference](https://readthedocs.org/projects/symbiyosys/downloads/pdf/latest/)
SBY will be used for BMC, the Bounded Model Checking, evaluation.
This method allows submodules to be developed and tested individually.
Assignments should not require unique testbenches.
