#### Part of Series:
  | 07-uart |
  ---------------------
  | => **07A-uart-placeholder** |

## Assignment 07A "UART PLACEHOLDER"
  
  
#### Your UUT will be checked against a Golden reference. 
  Every clockcyle:

  - UUT State must match REF state  
  - UUT Outputs must match REF Outputs
  - If your UUT and the REF diverge the simulation will halt immediatly

  use GTKWave (The software hiding behind the Debug/Spider button) to debug any issues.\
  *This task uses a golden reference. Therefore the trace in GTKwave will always end at the divergence/error point*

# Task
  Use the provided state graph to implement a basic Two Wire slave.

  | The skeleton UUT (Unit Under Test) file is given with relevant input and outputs. |

  Good luck!
