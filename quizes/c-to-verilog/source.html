<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Programming, as you will have done it up until now, in languages such as C
has been fairly straight forward. You write lines of code that the computer
then executes in the order you have written. Besides some processing to
turn the human text into machine readable instructions (assembly/machine
code) the essence of the program you write is maintained. The order of
execution for variables, if-statements, functions calls, etc is the same to you
as it is to the computer. C code becomes instructions the computer can
execute.
